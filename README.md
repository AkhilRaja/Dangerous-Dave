Dave was the first ever game I created. I had a lot of help from friends, but it is something I will really be proud of. I had progressed on my learning path and I decided to push my luck and recreate Dave allover. I did so in JS this time and it is much cleaner and better than before.

Logic is much simpler and easier to understand and concepts implemented are really close to modern day techniques.
